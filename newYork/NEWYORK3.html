                <p>The present mayor is Bill de Blasio, the first Democrat since 1993.
                     He was elected in 2013 with over 73% of the vote, and assumed office on January 1, 2014.

                        The Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices. As of April 2016, 69% of registered voters
                         in the city are Democrats and 10% are Republicans. New York City has not been carried by 
                         a Republican in a statewide or presidential election since President Calvin Coolidge won
                          the five boroughs in 1924. In 2012, Democrat Barack Obama became the first presidential 
                          candidate of any party to receive more than 80% of the overall vote in New York City,
                           sweeping all five boroughs. Party platforms center on affordable housing, education, 
                           and economic development, and labor politics are of importance in the city.</p>

                <p>During the Wisconsin glaciation, 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, the New York City region was situated
                     at the edge of a large ice sheet over 2,000 feet (610 m) in depth.
                      The erosive forward movement of the ice (and its subsequent retreat) contributed to the separation 
                      of what is now Long Island and Staten Island. That action also left bedrock at a relatively shallow depth,
                       providing a solid foundation for most of Manhattan's skyscrapers.

                        In the precolonial era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquian Native Americans,
                         including the Lenape, whose homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included Staten Island; the western portion
                          of Long Island, including the area that would become Brooklyn and Queens; Manhattan; the Bronx;
                           and the Lower Hudson Valley.
                        
                        The first documented visit into New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano,
                         a Florentine explorer in the service of the French crown. He claimed the area for France and named it
                          Nouvelle Angoulême (New Angoulême). A Spanish expedition led by captain Estêvão Gomes, a Portuguese
                           sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of
                            the Hudson River, which he named Río de San Antonio (Saint Anthony's River). The Padrón Real of 1527,
                             the first scientific map to show the East Coast of North America continuously, was informed by Gomes'
                              expedition and labeled the northeastern United States as Tierra de Esteban Gómez in his honor.</p>

                <p>The City of New York, usually called either New York City (NYC) or simply New York (NY)
                    , is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2018 population of 8,398,748
                     distributed over a land area of about 302.6 square miles (784 km2),
                      New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.
                      Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York 
                      metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass and one
                       of the world's most populous megacities, with an estimated 19,979,477 people
                     in its 2018 Metropolitan Statistical Area and 22,679,948 residents in its Combined Statistical Area.
                     A global power city, New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital
                     of the world, and exerts a significant
                     impact upon commerce,entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports.
                     The city's fast pace has inspired the term New York minute. Home to the headquarters of 
                    the United Nations New York is an important center for international diplomacy.</p>

                <p>New York City is situated in the Northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State,
                     approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston.The location at the mouth of the Hudson River,
                      which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow
                       in significance as a trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of Long Island,
                        Manhattan, and Staten Island.

                        The Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy,
                         New York, the river is an estuary.[183] The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of
                          New Jersey. The East River—a tidal strait—flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and
                           Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers,

                            separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx. The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester
                             County, is the only entirely fresh water river in the city.
                        
                        The city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along
                         the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times; reclamation is most prominent in Lower Manhattan, with developments
                          such as Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the natural relief in topography has been evened out,
                           especially in Manhattan.
                        
                        The city's total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37 km2), including 302.643 sq mi (783.84 km2) of land and
                         165.841 sq mi (429.53 km2) of this is water. The highest point in the city is Todt Hill 
                         on Staten Island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9 m) above sea level, is the highest point on the 
                         Eastern Seaboard south of Maine.The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in woodlands as part
                          of the Staten Island Greenbelt.</p>
